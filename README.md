# WhatsApp Group Contact Scrapper
 Simply run this code on your browser console on a WhatsApp Web window with a group open and it will downaload a CSV with all the non-contact members (name, phone, status). 

## Actually works?

Well, I found some older versions and updated them for my needs, so this now works but it might stop doing so at some point. Cool thing is its super easy to check! 

## What do I need to do? 

Copy the code from scrape.js and paste in your console. The code works in Whatsapp in English. Change the language of your Whatsapp (https://faq.whatsapp.com/829213944193764/?locale=en_US) or modify the following 3 variables: YOU_TITLE ("You" in English), PHOTO_SELECT_TITLE ("Photo Picker" in English) and SEARCH_EXPANDED_TITLE ("Search Participants" in English). Find out the translation employed on the site (these are the titles of certain elements) and update the code (you can find these variables in lines 11-13).
